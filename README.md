# MSG Saucer
MSG Saucer will run in the background and allow you to send/receive messages from other MSG Saucer users without connecting to a central server. The messenger will run in the background and deliver messages to the first terminal session you activate.

## Port Forwarding
MSG Saucer can always be used over your local (LAN) network, however, to use it over the broader internet you must port forward port 2523 to your computer. You can also use workarounds such as ngrok, which may require sending to a different port number.
